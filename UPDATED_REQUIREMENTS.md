# Updated CreateMemory Requirements

## All Fields Are Now Required

All fields in the CreateMemory form are now required (no optional fields):

1. **Title** - Required
2. **Location** - Required
3. **Date** - Required
4. **Memory Text** - Required
5. **Photos** - At least one photo is required

## User Authentication

## Client-side Validation

- All fields are validated before submit

## Backend Validation (API serverless)

- API endpoint `/api/cloudinary/memory` validates all required fields
- Returns error if any field is missing or invalid
- Image upload is mandatory (at least 1 image, max 10)
- User ID is checked (if required)

## Image Upload

- Images are uploaded via multipart form-data to the serverless API
- Only image files are accepted (jpg, png, webp, ...)
- At least one image is required, max 10 images per memory

## Error Handling & UX

- If the form is submitted with missing/invalid fields, validation messages show exactly which fields need to be completed
- If the backend returns an error, a user-friendly error message is displayed
- Loading spinner is shown during save
- Form is reset after successful save

## UI Updates

- All required fields are visually marked
- Error messages are styled and easy to see
- Loading and success states are clear
