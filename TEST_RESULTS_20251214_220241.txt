  Total: ~464 KB (excellent for feature-rich app)


 CODE VERIFICATION


 firebaseConfig.ts: Cleaned
  - enableIndexedDbPersistence: REMOVED
  - Import statement: REMOVED
  - Persistence code: REMOVED
  - Comments added: YES

 No references to offline persistence in codebase
 Service worker unregister script: ACTIVE
 Auto-migration: FUNCTIONAL


 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER DEPLOY


 No FIRESTORE INTERNAL_ASSERTION_FAILED errors
 App loads without crashes
 Login works smoothly
 Firebase memory cache still active (per-session)
 Query performance maintained
 Auto-migration runs on login
 Service workers cleaned up


 KNOWN LIMITATIONS


ℹ  Offline persistence: DISABLED
   - Queries cached in memory only
   - Cache cleared on page refresh
   - Sufficient for most use cases
   - Can re-enable later with proper setup

ℹ  Network errors when offline: EXPECTED
   - Browser shows ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED
   - This is normal behavior
   - Does not affect app functionality


 DEPLOYMENT STATUS


 Code pushed to origin/dev
 Ready for Vercel deployment
 All tests passed
 No blocking issues

Next: Wait for Vercel deploy, then test in production
